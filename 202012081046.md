Zettelkasten structure must consist of three main ideas: 
1. Arbitrary internal branching. This means the structure is not in advanced. Must leave room for organic growth. 
2. The key to making zettelkasten work is [linking](202012081141.md) ideas together. Zettel that are not linked with will become lost. 
3. There should be some kind of register based on keywords and structural notes. Keywords are saved in the tags. Structural notes are notes that consist of other notes that have been organized in some manner.

Furthermore, there are [three types of notes:](202012081709.md) that each serve a different purpose. Zettel that make it into the slip box should be complete thoughts with citations. A zettel should make sense to someone else who reads it. Utilizing zettelkasten yields clearly separable tasks(p. ; p. 69) that can be accomplished in a reasonable time and gives instant feedback through interconnected writing tasks.
