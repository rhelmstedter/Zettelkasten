Good writing is based good note taking. It is easier to organize a longer work by piecing it together from shorter works. As such, it is not a matter of willpower. Rather, it requires creating a structure in which you can reach flow. 

Flow does not not happen by chance. If the system is too difficult navigate, it will fail. If there is too much to think about, it will fail. Once you build trust in the system it becomes empowering([Power of Linking](202012081141.md)). You can unburden yourself with memorizing every detail by relying on the system. 

In order to achieve flow you must create enough momentum to fall into a positive feedback loop by creating satisfying repeatable experiences (p. 52).
