1. Fleeting notes: these come in two flavors.
    - a) The first are ideas that pop into your head. These go into an inbox (i.e. notebook) to be processed. They are discarded after being processed.
    - b) the second are project specifics notes. These are either thrown away or archived when the project is completed.
2. Literature notes: as you read, write down ideas, or references to ideas (i.e. page numbers) that you do not want to lose. Show be short and in your own words. These are placed in the reference slip box.
3. Permanent notes: these are the only notes that actually make it into the zettelkasten. These notes are designed to develop ideas and arguments. These are where links are created to other zettels.
