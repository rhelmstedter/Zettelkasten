>To be able to become an expert, we need the freedom to make our own decisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn. Like bicycling, it can only be learned by doing. Most study guides and academic writing teachers are trying very hard to spare you from that experience by telling you what, when, and how to write instead. But they are keeping you from learning the very think academia and writing is all about: gaining insight and making it public (Ahrens, 2017, p.64). 

Experts, through the use of deliberate practice, have internalized various processes so they do not have to actively remember rules and get bogged down in procedures. Through acquiring enough experience experts are able to act intuitively as opposed to long form analytics.
