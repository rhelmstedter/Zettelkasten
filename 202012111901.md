> We need to move the blood. - (Tollefson, 2019)

Kaia required breaks roughly every 50 mins, James Tanton takes breaks every 37.5 mins, Christian from zettelkasten.de takes breaks every 45 mins. Channeling my inner Raymond Hettinger, ~~there must be a better way~~ they must be onto something. Ahrens (2017) claims breaks are more then opportunities to recover. They allow the brain to process information (subconsciously :?: ) in order to move it into log term memory.
