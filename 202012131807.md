Reading and then rereading is ineffective because of the mere-exposure effect. When we reread text, we become familiar with it independent of understanding. Familiarity during rereading causes the brain to feel like it has retrieved the information without going through the retrieval process. The result is we feel like we have learned without actually learning. 

The opposite of rereading is [elaboration](202012131810.md).
