I found out that I needed to upgrade Vim in order to use vim-zettel without having an error. Next step is to figure out how to add a citation. Actually citations might be overrated? Not sure about this yet. Even more success 5 days later. Can link my vim Zettelkasten with Settle for a nice user interface.
