It is impossible to focus attention on more than one thing at a time. True multitasking is shifting attention between two or more things rapidly. While people believe that they can get better at multitasking, this is based on two fallacies: 1) a lack of a control group, 2) the mere-exposure effect (Bornstein, 1989). We conflate familiarity with skill. Attempting to multitask constantly reduces one's ability to multitask. 


Instead, concentrate on the task at hand with the appropriate level of concern, focus, and flexibility (Marcus Aurelius & Hayes, 2002, 2.5).
