> We need to move the blood. — (Tollefson, 2019)

Kaia required breaks roughly every 50 mins, James Tanton takes breaks every 37.5 mins, Christian from zettelkasten.de takes breaks every 45 mins. Channeling my inner Raymond Hettinger, "~~there must be a better way~~ they must be onto something." Ahrens (2017) claims breaks are more than opportunities to recover. They allow the brain to process information in order to move it into log term memory.

:?: #? Does this process happen subconsciously?
