Elaboration is the practice of thinking about the meaning of what we are reading, how it could inform questions, and how it could be used to connect to other knowledge. According to Stein et al. (1984), elaboration facilitates retention when the language used is related to the target concept. Elaboration that does not reduce the arbitrariness of relationships within content does not lead to better retention. However, elaborations that increase trace complexity and distinctiveness improve retention.
