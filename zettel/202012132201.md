I tend to think of repetition as boring. However, strategic use of repetition can be powerful.

E.g.:
- D. Conway repeats the fireworks slide in the talk [Everything you know about Regexes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubvSjW6Nyqks) is wrong twice in 14 mins. 
- Pastors use repetition to engage and create a theme.
