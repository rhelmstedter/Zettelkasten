The act of curating a zettelkasten follows the recommendations for best practices of learning ([elaboration](202012131810.md), spacing, variation, contextual interference, and retrieval). This leads to what Sachs (2013, p. 26) calls the virtuous cycle. The more we learn and retain, the more 'hooks' we have to build and link new learning to. This reinforces the act of learning and learning becomes fun. 

#TODO look up the Sachs study
