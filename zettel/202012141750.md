Since zettelkasten are designed to think in, not be a mere collection of facts, it is not enough to only move forward through the zettelkasten. One must compare and contrasts between existing notes. A new note might lead to a correction or restructuring of a previous note.

Prior to adding a note, one should check if that idea already exits.
