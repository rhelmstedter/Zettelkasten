Ahrens cites Reeve and Jan (2006) and Reeve (2009) claiming that the lack of autonomy and academic freedom is demotivating. How does he square this with the thesis of _The Paradox of Choice_ that choice decreases productivity. Is choice in how to do something different than choice in what to study?
