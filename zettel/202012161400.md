Brainstorming is overrated because the brain prioritizes information that is more easily accessed, e.g. recently reviewed information or ideas with an emotional connection. Ideas that are abstract, vague, or emotionally neutral are lower in priority, regardless of how relevant they are.

Relying on the zettelkasten, however, shows you were ideas have clustered over time. Relevance is increased because you determined the information important enough to write a note of it.
