Good writing is based on good note-taking. It is easier to organize a
longer work by piecing it together from shorter works. As such, it is
not a matter of willpower. Rather, it requires creating a structure in
which you can reach flow.

Flow does not happen by chance ([Achieve Flow](202012081433.md)). If the system
is too difficult to navigate, it will fail. If there is too much to think about, it will fail. Once you build trust in the system, it becomes empowering [Power of Linking](202012081141.md). You can unburden yourself from memorizing
every detail by relying on the system.
