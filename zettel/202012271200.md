PNC states that true contradiction cannot exist. Identified by Aristotle in Metaphysics Book Iv (Gamma) as the firmest axiom of the universe. Anyone who rejects the PNC surrenders the capacity for intelligent thought (p. 2).

The whole of logic, deduction, philosophy, mathematics, rests upon this idea.
