Paradoxes have been categorized by William Van Orman Quine into three classes:

veridical:: a sound argument that delivers an absurd yet true conclusion
falsidical:: an absurd result that stems from fallacious arguments 
antinomical:: inconsistency that stems from arguments considered standard and sound. This requires revision of the frameworks. 

One famous example of an antinomy is the statement, "This statement is false."
