Epistemology is the study of knowledge. Attempts to answer the questions: what is knowledge, what makes it valid, and how do we gain it? In order to further this goal, [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand) defines reason, rationality, and logic.

reason:: the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses into concepts and abstractions. 

rationality:: the virtue of recognizing and accepting reason as one's only source of knowledge.

>Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification. A contradiction cannot exist... No Concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge. To arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one's thinking; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one's mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality (Rand, 1957 as cited in Cook, 2020, p. 3).
