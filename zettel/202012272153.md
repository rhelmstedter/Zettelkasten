Since cutting is a destructive act, cut pieces of wood will never be the length of the original. Material, the width of the saw blade, is lost in the form of saw dust. Instead of lining up the middle of the saw with the cute line, the saw's blade should be placed to the outside of the cut (in the waste end). One way to be more accurate is to use a crow's feet marking ( V ) instead of a line. The crows feet should be pointed in the direction of the cut.
