bijection:: a one to one correspondence between two sets. 

A bijection between two sets means they have the same [cardinality](202012281142.md). 

One can construct a bijection between a line and a square. Consider the closed unit interval A = [0, 1] and the unit square B = [0, 1] x [0, 1]. For each point in A, divide the decimal into molecules. A molecule is defined by a non-zero digit and leading zeros. E.g., the number 0.310097006 can be decomposed into the molecules m_1 = 3, m_2 = 1, m_3 = 009, m_4 = 7, and m_5 = 006. Now, concatenate all even subscripted molecules and all odd subscripted molecules. Using this as a coordinate pair (x , y) yields (0.3009006, 0.17). Thus, every element of A can be mapped onto B.
