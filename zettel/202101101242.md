Experience is not always correlated with superior performance.

Superior performance (expertise) is found when the following conditions were met:
1. given a task with well defined goals
2. motivation to improve
3. provided with feedback
4. provided ample opportunities for repetition and gradual refinement

These conditions constitute deliberate practice.

"The best training situations focus on activities of short duration with opportunities for immediate feedback, reflection, and corrections" (Ericsson, 2008). Each trial should be followed by a similar task until it can be completed accurately and with fluency. Then the skill should be embedded in more complex contexts.
