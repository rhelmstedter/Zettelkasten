Stoicism comes from the stoa (porch or portico) in Athens where Zeno (332/3 - 262 B.C.E.) taught. A main tenant of stoicism is that the world is organized in a rational and consistent manner. There exits a logos that pervades through all things. At an individual level this is exemplified through reason. At a cosmic level this is nature. There is a sense of destiny intertwined with logos. 

While the idea originated with the Greeks when it was adopted by the Romans, it transitioned from a holistic system of thought to a practical approach to life.
