Our duty is to maintain control over perception while striving for objective truth.

We take in data through our senses and produce a mental impression (phantasia). From the phantasia the mind creates a perception (hypolepsis). Hopefully, this perception is an accurate representation of reality, but it may be distorted based on a number of factors o
such as preconceived notions, incomplete date, or biases.  

Marcus Aurelius struggles with the idea of identifiable events as good and evil when in fact they are neither good not evil, they just are.
