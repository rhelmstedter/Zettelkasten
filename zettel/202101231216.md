Our duty is to maintain control over perception while striving for objective truth.

We take in data through our senses and produce a mental impression (phantasia). From the phantasia the mind creates a perception (hypolepsis). Hopefully, this perception is an accurate representation of reality, but it may be distorted based on a number of factors such as preconceived notions, incomplete date, or biases.
