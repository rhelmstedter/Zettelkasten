"Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and freedom" - [Misattributed](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/18/response/) to Victor Frankl

In that space, anchor then center yourself with breath. This requires self-control (see: [Lessons from Maximus](202101240927.md)) that is available through the [deliberate practice](202101101242.md) of mindfulness. 


There is a strong overlap with stoicism.
