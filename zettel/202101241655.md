As students test the rules in the beginning there is a sharp increase in misbehavior. This can either continue to increase throughout the year, or, with good management, taper off and stabilize (figure 1, p. 8). While testing is typically initiated by a few students, because classrooms are public, this testing is witnessed by all.

1. start activities as soon as possible.
2. anticipate misbehavior and cut it off before it begins
3. monitor and stop misbehavior early
    - Focus on activities over misbehavior early in the year. Need to find the balance between ignoring minor infractions in order to protect the integrity of activities and letting things go.
