>The class room management industry provides the packaged, teacher-proof techniques and technologies of control, presumably offering teachers greater efficacy, but in reality diminishing further the moral and political space teachers require to pursue their craft conscientiously.

Many popular disciplinary techniques rely on manipulating behavior, often through the use of rewards and threats. While some techniques claim to be otherwise, they are truly behavioral stimulus-response in disguise. Glasser, for example, moved the external stimulus response to an internal stimulus response with his five needs.

These are at odds with the [Curriculum of Democratic Civility](202102011740.md). In fact, these disciplinary techniques are often counter productive in the long run even when judged on the basis of maintaining control and promoting academic learning.
