In the early 1800s, Lancaster moved away from the patriarchal notions of honor/shame of traditional schooling, instead focusing on a disciplinary structure for the industrial poor. It was a system of constant bureaucratic surveillance and ranking that pitted classmates against each other in competition. Pupils could move up in merits and hold authority over others. Motivation was embedded in the intricate processes not pedagogy and learning. 

Reminiscent of the pan option.
