This disciplinary structure stemmed from middle-class protestants and focused on an internalized authority. Whereas the [Lancasterian Disciplinary Structure](202102021700.md) was based on impersonal bureaucratic surveillance, the New England Pedagogy promoted emotionally intense, individualized relationships. Authority stemmed from guilt and self surveillance, with a deep emotional dependence on the authority figure. It rejected corporal punishment save for the poor whose families had failed to prepared them for gentler forms of discipline.
