With affectional authority (see [New England Pedagogy](202102021706.md)) and classical education out of the question for African and Native Americans, Armstrong argued they needed the guidance and civilizing influences of the superior white race. This consisted of a sacrificial racial paternalism in which white educators felt they were owed a debt for making the sacrifice of educating people of color. This was combined with surveillance that crept into student's personal lives and a curriculum that included many hours of manual labor.
