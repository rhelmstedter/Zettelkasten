Progressive era disciplinary structures, which remained largely intact until the 1950's, consisted of an emotional separation of teacher and student. The model teacher employed a hierarchical professional-client relationship marked by detachment, expertise, and scientific study. This was accompanied by a shift from lesson recitation to self-direction, activities, and learning-by-doing. It was an attempt to embed disciplinary structure within pedagogy and learning. The belief being that misbehavior stems from misguided expectations from quiet, stillness and extended attention. The answer was to free a child from artificial and arbitrary constrictions, and provide access to curricula of interest to the student. 

As the classroom became more learner-centered, surveillance, and therefore accountability, shifted to the teacher. This also led to the expansion of administration and paradoxically placed more emphasis on classroom management.
