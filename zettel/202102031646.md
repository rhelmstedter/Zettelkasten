There are two definitions of discipline. 

1. Discipline is a disposition that governs one's actions. It is self-initiated, self-regulated, and holds intrinsic value relating to the activity at hand.
2. Discipline is something that is imposed on one for being unruly. It is aimed at shaping activities in a manner deemed appropriate by the authority.
