Levin and Nolan posit the teacher has the responsibility to employ techniques that maximize on-task behavior. They admit that no teacher can force a change in the behavior of a student. They claim that by learning psychology, studying child developing and implementing other instructional techniques, and thereby modifying their own behavior, teachers can increase the probability of producing desired behavior in students. 

Compare this with The First Days of School (Wong & Wong, 2009, p. 88) the effective teacher. 

1. Works on having a well-managed classroom.
2. establishes consistency in the classroom.
3. Has students working on task.
4. Has a classroom with little confusion or waster time.
