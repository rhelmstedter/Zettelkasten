Gnagey offers a systematic disciplinary structure that builds on (plagiarizes) Tyler's work on curriculum. 

1. Arrange seating to optimize surveillance. 
2. Select a steering group to use as a barometer.
3. Scan the room frequently so that to can catch misbehavior early.
4. Look for concealment strategies and ensure that student's know that they will not get away with anything no matter how minor.

This has strong secret police or Big Brother feel to it.
