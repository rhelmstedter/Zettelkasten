Canter's work Back to school with Assertive Discipline aligns with the work of C.M. Charles, asserting that students need teachers to manipulate and cajole them to behave well. Teachers should establish clear and enforceable rules early on. Rules should be posted and have unambiguous consequences. A system of positive rewards is the most powerful tool a teacher has to shape appropriate behavior.

This has strong CHAMPS vibes to it, as well as The First Days of School.
