Beyer argues that educational policy and praxis are shaped by our meaning of democracy, of which there is no singular, unambiguous definition. Instead, it is helpful to consider democratic values as normative parameters rather than a set of subscribed procedures and practices. True democratic freedom lies not in individualism and infinite choice. Though there is a need for individual responsibility. Social context is what defines use as people. Communities that pursue the common good provide that context, but are unable to thrive in the midst of growing social, political, and economic inequities of the US (similar to Sandel's argument).
