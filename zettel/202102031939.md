If education should be working towards democratic ends, the means must be meaningful and challenging for students. Education must recognize students for who they are while fostering understanding that will allow them to participate in a democratic society([What is democracy?](202102031931.md)). Furthermore, teachers must let go of conventional wisdom that students must be manipulated, controlled, and cajoled to behave, and accept the idea that students can reason about and contribute to the creation of the learning environment.
