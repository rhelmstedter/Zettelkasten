If you can avoid these words for a week it will improve your writing.

- very
- rather
- really
- quite
- in fact
- just (when meaning merely)
- pretty (as in pretty good cake)
- of course
- actually
- so
- surely
- that said

If you have to, write them and then go back and edit them out. If something feels off, rewrite the sentence.
