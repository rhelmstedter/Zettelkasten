```python
import unittest 
import script

class TestScript(unittest.TestCase):
        
        def test_function(self):
                result = script.function(args)
                self.assertEqual(result, value)
```

In this example, script is the script you are trying to test. Create a class that inherits `unittest.TestCase` from the unittest module. Define a function that has self as the argument. The name of the function must start with `test_`. Create a result variable and assign it a value of the function you are trying to test. The arguments should cover various cases. Then choose which unittest method is appropriate. In this example, `assertEqual` tests if the result is equal to a given value. 

To run in the terminal use `python -m unittest test_script.py`. Or add the following lines to the test script and run using just python.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
```
