First import the re module. Then there are two options.

1. `re.function(pattern, string, flag)`

2. If you need to repeat a search throughout the script use the `re.compile` to create a regular expression object then call search() or match() to return a search object.

While the second is more complicated to create, it gives you the most flexibility. 

The sequence

```python
regex_object = re.compile(pattern)
result = regex_object.match(string)
```

Is equivalent to

`result = re.match(pattern, string)`
