What is good for business is often at odds with what is good for customers. Talwalker offers the example of gas stations being clustered in cities. Consider a simplified example of taco carts on the beach. If a taco cart wants to service the most number of customers and minimize walking, they would choose to locate in the center of the beach. Now, consider a second cart has set up shop. If the second cart splits the difference between the edge of the beach and the center, they only control the first 3/8 of the beach. The original taco cart controls the rest of the market. The second cart is incentivized to locate as close to the center as possible. This is at odds with what is good for customers. The ideal location for customers is for both taco carts to be located one third of the way down the beach, thereby minimizing walking distance for customers.
