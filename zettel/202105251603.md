Importing like below allows us to avoid having to type `datetime.datetime.today()`. Datetime objects include both the date and time, date objects only include the date.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from datetime import date
```
`datetime.today()` returns a datetime object formatted as
`datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec, msec)`

You can manually set a date using a variable.
`variable = date(month, day, year)`

The strftime() method takes a datetime object and formats it into a string. You can format is using the [%formatcodes]( https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp).

Formatted as:
`<datetime_object>.strftime(‘format’)`
 
The strptime() method takes a string and converts it to a datetime object.

Formatted as: 
`datetime.strptime(string, ‘format’)`
