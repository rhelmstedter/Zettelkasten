I finished up my countdown to the end of school timer. I wanted to add a feature that counts only the remaining school days. I learned that numpy has a function that calculates business days only. I can leverage that function to remove the weekend days. Then it is just a matter of determining holidays and breaks and subtracting those from the remaining days. This would be a great little project for coding next year. I also spoke with Alex, briefly, about creating an LED sign that displays the countdown and mounting on the wall for next year.
