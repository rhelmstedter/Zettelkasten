Iteration is a process of moving through individual components of an object. Strings are iterable and the components are the characters. Lists are iterable, and whatever is separated by commas are the objects. 

The `cycle()` function from itertools allows you to cycle through an iterable using the built in next function. Another option is to create an `itertools.cycle()` object that is iterated over with a for loop. The result is a never ending loop that cycles through all the components in the object. The example below is missing the import statements, but illustrates the principle.

```python3
colors = "Red Green Yellow".split()
rotation = itertools.cycle(colors)

def rg_timer():
    return random.randint(3, 7)

def light_rotation(rotation):
    for color in rotation:
        if color == "Yellow":
            print(f"Caution! The light is {color}")
            sleep(3)
        elif color == "Red":
            print(f"STOP! The light is {color}")
            sleep(rg_timer())
        else:
            print(f"Go! The light is {color}")
            sleep(rg_timer())
```
