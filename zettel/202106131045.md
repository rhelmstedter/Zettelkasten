When Abraham Lincoln was young, he would write and rewrite things he had heard or read in order to learn them (see: [Thinking Outside the Brain](202012141540.md)). He would also takes stories he heard from his father or other adults, digest them, and retell them in kid friendly language to entertain his friends. He had a cycle of being exposed to a topic -> digesting it -> reciting it through story telling or writing.
