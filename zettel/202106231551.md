create a class by using the `class` keyword and the class name. By convention, class names should begin with capital letters.

Any function inside a class is a method. Any variable inside of a class is an attribute. Once you have created an instance of a class, you can call attributes and methods using the dot notation, for example, `instance.attribute` or `instance.method()`.
