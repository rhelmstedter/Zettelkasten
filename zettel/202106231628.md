Below is an example of a class called car, with attributes of model, and color, and a method of description. 

```python
class Car:
	def __init__(self, model, color):
		self.model = model
		self.color = color
		
	def description(self):
		print(f"The model of your car is {self.model}.")
		print(f"The color of your car is {self.color}.")
```

Using the `__init__` function with the first parameter of self allows us to create instance (which is now an object) of our class with specific attributes. These objects can be assigned to a variable. For example, my first car ever was a 1966 Mustang. I painted it blue with black racing stripes. I can create an instance of the Car class as shown below.

```python
first_car = Car("Mustang", "blue")

print(first_car.model)
print(first_car.color)
first_car.description()
```

Output:

Mustang
blue
The model of your car is Mustang.
The color of your car is blue.
