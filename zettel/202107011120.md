Use a context manager to open a csv file. While there are several types of readers, the `csv.DictReader()` is the best according to Michael Kennedy. This is even more powerful when you pair it with a named tuple (see: [Collections](202105301319.md)). You can assign parameters for the named tuple that match the column names in the csv file. As long as the dictionary exactly matches the parameters of the named tuple you can unpack and assign everything with the `**` notation.

```python
import csv
from collections import namedtuple

Namedtuple = namedtuple("Namedtuple", "first,line,of,csv")

with open(filename) as f:
	reader = csv.DictReader(f)
	for row in reader:
		info = Namedtuple(**row)
```
