We can slice data frames in several ways.

Using square brackets: `df['column name']` returns a [series](202107021207.md), while `df[['list', 'of', 'columns']]` returns a data frame of only the specified columns.

`df.columns` is an attribute that will return an Index object of all of the column names.

`df.iloc[]` returns rows and columns based on integer locations, while `df.loc[]` filters based on labels. These labels can be custom indexes (see: [Indexing](202107021325.md)) for the rows, or the column names. Both methods take two parameters, the first is the rows, and the second is the columns. These can be passed in as lists of specific rows and columns, or you can treat rows and columns like strings and slice with the `:` notation.
