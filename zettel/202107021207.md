A series is technically speaking a one dimensional array. In practice it is list of all of the rows in a data frame for a given column. Even though a series is one dimensional it can appear to be 2 dimensional because of the index is separate from the values. In fact, the single axis of a series is the index. If no index is specified, I believe the default is a series of integers starting at 0.
