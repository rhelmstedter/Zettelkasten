Set custom indexes from one of the series in the data frame by using the `df.set_index("column_to_be_index")` method. This does not change the data frame unless a keyword argument is set as `inplace=True`. Or alternatively, when building the data frame initially, you can set the index column. `df = pd.read_csv(path_to_file, index_col='Column_to_be_index')`. You can also use `df.sort_index()` which will sort the data frame based on the index.

In his example, Schafer set the index of the schema data frame to be the first column of the data frame. This allowed him to search for the data using `df.loc["Hobbyist"]` to get the row. In other words, he didn't have to count the number of rows to get to hobbyist and then use `df.iloc[2]`.
