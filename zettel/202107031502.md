We can manipulate column names in lots of ways.

- Use list comprehension with string methods on `df.columns`
- `df.rename(columns={"original": "new"}, inplace=True)`

Manipulating Rows with Methods

- `Series.apply()`:: allows you to apply functions to every value in a series. `df["column"].apply(function)`. Be sure to leave the parenthesis off the function so that you are passing the function it self, and not an executed instance of the function. You can also create a lambda function within `apply()`.
- `df.applymap()`:: This is similar to apply(), but works on every individual element in a data frame.
- `Series.map()`:: map only works on series. Similar to the `.rename()` method above. Pass in a dictionary with the original and the new value. Whatever is not explicitly mapped is set to NaN.
- `Series.replace()`:: similar to map, but whatever is not explicitly mapped is left alone.
