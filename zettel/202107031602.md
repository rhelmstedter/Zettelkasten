The most common need I have is to split text on a space. For example, I need to split a column of full_name into separate columns of first_name and last_name so I can sort on the last name. To do this, pass a list of the new columns to be created. Then assign that to the column that needs to be split. Use the string method split with the argument `expand=True`. The expand argument returns the split values as a data frame.

`df[["first_name", "last_name"]] = df["full_name"].str.split(' ', expand=True)`
