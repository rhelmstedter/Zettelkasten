Aggregate functions take multiple values and returns a singular value. Mean, median, and mode are examples of aggregate functions. 

`df.describe()` will identify numerical values and return several aggregate functions.

`df["Column"].value_counts(normalize=True)` will return value counts as a percentage.

A groupby operation is a process of splitting the object, applying a function, and then combining the results. `df.groupby(["Column"])` returns a groupby object that splits up the dataframe based on the column name. It essentially creates a filter for every possibility in the given column so you don't have to manually create that filter.

After grouping by multiple columns, you can then use `.unstack()` to get rid of the multiple indexes. This worked great for my [coding experience graph](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HOPlWe5pcVTNRrTItAin9JzGpDN9_oAF#scrollTo=rQu-WuI11wWc) that I wanted.
