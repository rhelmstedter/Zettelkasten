Aggregate functions take multiple values and returns a singular value. Mean, median, and mode are examples of aggregate functions. 

`df.describe()` will identify numerical values and return several aggregate functions.

`df["Column"].value_counts(normalize=True)` will return value counts as a percentage.

A groupby operation is a process of splitting the object, applying a function, and then combining the results. `df.groupby(["Column"])` returns a groupby object that splits up the dataframe based on the column name. It essentially creates a filter for every possibility in the given column so you don't have to manually create that filter.
