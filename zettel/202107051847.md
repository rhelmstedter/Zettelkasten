Convert strings to a datetime object using `df["date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date_column"], format = "%format_string")`. These are the same format strings from the `datetime` module in python (see: [Datetime and Dates](202105251603.md)). Alternatively, you can convert string dates in a csv file as you read it in, but this requires creating a lambda function and then passing which column to parse and how to parse it as arguments. The reason these two are different is because the first option reads in a series, while the second on reads in the individual strings.

```python
date_parser = lambda x: pd.datetime.strptime(x, "format_string")
df = pd.read_csv("file.csv", parse_dates=["Date_Columns"], date_parser=date_parser)
```

Now that we are working with datetime objects, we can access them using the dt class. For example, to get the day of the week we can use `df["date"].dt.day_name()` which returns a series. You can even store this in a new column `df["Day_of_Week"] = df["date"].dt.day_name()` and use it to group by (see: [Aggregation](202107041200.md)). We can also use other functions on them, e.g., `.min()`, `.max()`, or even subtract them and get a timedelta object.

If you have time stamps in the data set and they are unique it is a good idea to use them as an index. After converting the strings to datetime objects, use `df.set_index("date", inplace=True)`. Now you can filter by dates using slicing, `df["start_date":"end_date"]`.

Re-sampling data lets you change how the data is organized if you have it indexed by datetime objects. There are [format codes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#dateoffset-objects) available in the docs and you can decide how it aggregates the data using any of the available functions such as min, max, or mean, e.g., `df["Column"].resample("format_code").aggregate_function()`.

Re-sampling the entire data frame with different functions for different columns is also possible: `df.resample("format_code").agg({"Column1": "mean", "Column2": "min"})`.
