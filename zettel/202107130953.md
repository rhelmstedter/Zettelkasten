Teddy Roosevelt's political opportunities were granted through privilege. Privilege of name, location, and connection. However, opportunity does not guarantee success. Roosevelt attributes his success to the development of ordinary skills to an extraordinary degree (see: [Character](202101240935.md).

:question: #question
Would this same grit/ambition lead to success without the presence of privilege? Is privilege sufficient for success without grit/ambition?
