There are four commands associated with dates:

+ `due`: you know
+ `scheduled`: the task will not be considered ready until the scheduled date. At the scheduled date, there will be a `ready` report and at `+READY` virtual tag available.
+ `wait`: the task will not show up until the wait date.
+ `until`: this will auto-expire a task. This is useful for time sensitive tasks that cannot be completed after the due date.
