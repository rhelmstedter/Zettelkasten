Lincoln used figurative language that allowed his audience to see the issue at hand and make up their own mind. This mirrored the technique he used in the courtroom to convince the jury that they were trying the case not her. According to the *Springfield Journal*, "Mr. Lincoln's eloquence was of the higher type, which produced conviction in others because of the conviction of the speaker himself (p. 115)." As such, leadership requires sincerity and the ability to bring people to your position, but ultimately choose it for themselves.
