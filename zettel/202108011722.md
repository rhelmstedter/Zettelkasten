Teddy Roosevelt possessed the self-awareness to recognize his strengths and compensate for his weaknesses. When he volunteered to serve in the army he was offered a leadership position for special regiment, eventually known as the Rough Riders. He declined the position of Colonel because he knew that he would not have the necessary skills to outfit the team initially. Instead, he nominated his friend and offered to serve as the number two in command. This was done to guarantee the success of the regiment over the personal glory. While his friend procured the necessary supplies and handled the logistics, Roosevelt leaned on his strengths. He publicized and recruited talent for the regiment instead. They ended up receiving so many applications, Roosevelt convinced the army to expand the original three regiments to five in total (TODO: check that number)
