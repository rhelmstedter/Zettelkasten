One way of storing sensitive objects like personal access tokens and passwords is to create an environment variable. Use an editor to open `<virtural environment name>/bin/activate`. Go to the end of the file and type `export <environment variable>=<token>`. Then, in your python script `import os` and create a variable `token = os.environ["<environment variable>"]`. The whole point of this is to avoid having your password and access tokens hard coded in your scripts. It is also important to note that if you are going to post the repository publicly using Github, be sure your `.gitignore` file ignores your virtual environment directory. Otherwise your environment variable will be posted publicly as well.

For a more concrete example recall we did this when working with the Github api in the #100DaysofCode course. In the terminal I used `nvim .venv/bin/activate`, Then created an environment variable with `export GH_GIST_CREATE_TOKEN='personalaccesstokenfromgithub'`. Then in the python script I imported the os module and created the token variable as `token = os.environ["GH_GIST_CREATE_TOKEN"]`.
