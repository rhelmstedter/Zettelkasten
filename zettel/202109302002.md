Create a data class with the following:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DataClassCard:
	rank: str
	suit: str
```

Data classes come with a lot of the functionality of regular classes such as instantiating, printing and comparing with dot notation. It also includes `__.repr__()` and `.__eq__() ` methods that would require a lot more boiler plate code to implement. For simple data structures such as representing a deck of cards, you could use a tuple, named tuple, or dictionary. Using the data class allows for attributes of your objects to be updated. If using a named tuple, data is immutable.
