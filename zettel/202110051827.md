Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a methodology that can help you write better code. The premise of TDD is that one should start with the goal in mind and then write code that meets the expressed goal. This is akin to backwards mapping in teaching. Start with the standards, determine how those standards should be assessed, and then design learning activities. In the case of TDD, you should have an idea for a program, write tests, and then write functions that meet those tests. The gold standard of testing libraries is pytest. You can use unittest (see: [Unit testing in Python](202104050950.md)) but pytest has more features and is more popular currently.

According to Giordani (2020) there are rules of TDD:
+ Rule Number 1: Test first, code later
+ Rule Number 2: Add the reasonably minimum amount of code you need to pass the tests
+ Rule Number 3: You shouldn't have more than one failing test at a time
+ Rule Number 4: Write code that passes the test. Then refactor it.
+ Rule Number 5: A test should fail the first time you run it. If it doesn't, ask yourself why you are adding it.
+ Rule Number 6: Never refactor without tests
