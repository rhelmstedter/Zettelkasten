Create a context manager in python by using the keyword `with`. The context manager handles opening and closing files so you don't have to worry about it.

With working on Advent of Code 2020, I learned that you can use context managers inside of a function. My previous understanding was that you had to have the entirety of the program inside a context manager. Turns out once you have stored the contents of the file, for example in a list, you can continue the program outside the context manager. Below is an example from Real Python:

```python
# letters.py

from collections import Counter

def count_letters(filename):
    letter_counter = Counter()
    with open(filename) as file:
        for line in file:
            line_letters = [
                char for char in line.lower() if char.isalpha()
            ]
            letter_counter.update(Counter(line_letters))
    return letter_counter
```
