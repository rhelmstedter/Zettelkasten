Sandel describes the admissions scandal at USC. Singer, the mastermind of the scam, called his technique the side door entrance. Whereas traditionally the back door was admission to university through a donation to the school, the side door was a series of bribes and false credentials. Further more, the back door resulted in donations being applied to the school overall while the side door lined the pockets of individual actors. Both allowed wealth to override merit.
