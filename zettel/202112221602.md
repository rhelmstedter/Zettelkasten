How do political parties address legitimate concerns that are entangled with xenophobia and bigotry? I am not convinced that critical race theory and identify politics are the answer. Nor am I convinced that CRT is a left wing instrument of indoctrination. Sandel describes two diagnosis for the anger and resentment of the populists. 

1. White males who are used to dominating society are losing said authority 
2. There is instability of jobs careers. As globalization is an unstoppable force in today's world job training will be required.
