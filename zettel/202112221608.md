The Technocratic approach to governing is a detached, antiseptical form of government that relies on technical expertise. This reliance on experts to create and implement solutions alienates the common man and their ability to participate in democracy. 

The core belief of the Technocratic approach is intertwined with the belief that market mechanisms will be instrumental in achieving the public good. (Often times the evaluation of the public good is indicated by GDP.) But, market-driven globalization has brought going inequality.

Technocratic governance is not limited to one party. Reagan, Clinton, and Obama have all posited that the market can provide solutions unobtainable by the government alone.
