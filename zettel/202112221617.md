Within a perfect meritocracy there is no room for solidarity amongst the winners and losers. The winners are full of hubris and disdain for those who are less successful. The losers are humiliated and resentful of the winners.

Sandel argues the tyranny of merit arises from three main points:

1. During conditions of vast inequality and stalled mobility pushing the message that we are responsible for our own fate demoralizes those who are left behind by globalization (see: [How to handle polarization of politics?](202112221602.md)).
2. Insisting that a college degree is the primary route to a respectable job and a decent life undermines the dignity of work and dehumanizes those without a college degree (see: [College](202112221620.md)).
3. Insisting that problems be solved by value neutral experts corrupts democracy and disempowers ordinary citizens (see: [Technocratic Approach to Governing](202112221608.md)).
