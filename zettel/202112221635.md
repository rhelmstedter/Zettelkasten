Sandel claims the rhetoric of rising first now rings hollow. The richest one percent of Americans make more than the bottom half combined. Sandel also claims it is easier to rise from poverty in Canada, Germany, Denmark, and other European countries (p. 23).

> Anyone should be able to rise as far as their talents and hard work will take them. (p. 67)

Reagan was the first president to popularize the phrase within political rhetoric. But both Clinton and Obama were found of similar phrases. Obama often borrowed from a pop song, "you can make it if you try". According to Sandel, there is a not so mentioned dark side to this rhetoric. If opportunities are equal, and there exists a perfect meritocracy, then those who are not successful deserve what they get.

Also, see responsibility.
