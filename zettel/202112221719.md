During her 2016 presidential campaign, Clinton declared, "I want this to be a true meritocracy. I'm tired of inequality (p. 71)." I argue, however, that meritocracy even in in its perfect form is not a recipe for equality. If we believe that access to health care and nutrition impacts physical and mental performance; If we believe in a growth vs fixed mindset; If we believe in Maslow's hierarchy of needs; If we believe that both nature and nurture impact physical and cognitive ability, then we cannot believe that the opportunity to rise as far as our talents will take us will result in an equality of outcomes.
