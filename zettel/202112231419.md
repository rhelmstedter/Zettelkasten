Trump used his credentials as both a sword and a shield. He provided cover for and built rapport with blue collar workers by rallying against elites and the judgment the passed on people without college degrees. Then he went on to use his own credentials (Fordham and the Wharton School of Finance) as an indication of how smart his is. Since he already built rapport by tapping into the populist anger, it allowed those without a college degree to feel *smart* as well. After all, the thinking goes, if this successful business man thinks the same way I do on topics, I must be right.

In a similar way, Brett Kavanaugh also used his credentials as a shield. When he was accused of getting drunk and sexually assaulting Dr. Ford, he did not only deny the accusation, he spoke about how hard he had worked during college. Though the accusation had nothing to do with his academic prowess, he presented a meritocratic defense of his time at Yale and Yale Law school. While clearly missing the point (see: [Irrelevant Conclusion](202112231500.md)), he tried to demonstrate how good of a student he was as a defense. How could such a good student do such a thing?
