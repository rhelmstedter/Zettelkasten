Political rhetoric has traditionally drawn from debates about just versus unjust, strong versus weak, open versus closed. With the prevalence of meritocratic thought, the newest contrast has been smart vs dumb. This shift in political rhetoric was ushered in again by Clinton and Obama. Both spoke of their policies as not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing to do. This implies then that being smart is superior to being right or just. This plays into the idea of the [technocratic approach to governing](202112221608.md).
