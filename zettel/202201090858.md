[PyBite 19](https://codechalleng.es/bites/19/) had the solver write a class that checks if a promotion was expired. I learned that the property decorator allows you call a method as you would an attribute. In the code below, I wrote a class with two attributes: 1) name 2) expires. (I think a better name for expires would be expiration_date.) Then, I used the property decorator to write a method that checks if the promo is expired or not. If the expiration date of the promo is less than the current date, that means it is expired and `expired()` should return true.

```python
from datetime import datetime

NOW = datetime.now()

class Promo:
    def __init__(self, name, expires):
        self.name = name
        self.expires = expires

    @property
    def expired(self):
        if self.expires < NOW:
            return True
```
