Panda broadcasts operations with scalars to all values in series. In other words, you don't have to iterate over rows in order to apply a scalar operation. E.g. if you need to double the values in a series you can use `series = series*2`. You should not iterate over rows.

Operations that are optimized to happen quickly in the CPU are referred to as _vectorization_
