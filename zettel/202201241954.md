Panda boadcasts operations with scalars to all values in series. In otherwords, you don't have to iteration over rows in order to apply a scalar operation. E.g. if you need to double the values in a series you can use `series = series*2`. you should not iterate over rows. Operations that are optimized to happen quickly in the CPU are referred to as _vectorization_
