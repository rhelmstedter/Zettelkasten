Theodore Roosevelt coined the term *bully pulpit* to describe the presidency as a place of moral inspiration (p. 106). With technocratic leaders such as Obama, the bully pulpit became a place for facts, data and good information. This hurts. I like basing decisions on facts. I like Obama's arugment of "bending the cost curve" when talking about healthcare. Sandel believes Obama should have made a moral argument for universal healthcare.
