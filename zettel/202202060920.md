People often vote against policies such as Obamacare even when it could be beneficial for them. Is this somehow tied to Sandel's argument against technocratic leadership? Does the fact that technocratic arguments for policies like NAFTA—policies that have left the working class in the cold—mean that technocratic arguments for health care fall flat? In other words, are people opposed to policy that could benefit them because they resent the party presenting and arguing the policy?
