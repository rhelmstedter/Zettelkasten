>One of the defects of the technocratic approach to politics is the fact that decision-making is in the hands of elites and so disempowers ordinary citizens. Another is that is abandons the project of political persuasion. Incentivizing people to act responsibly—to conserve energy or to watch their weight or to observe ethical business practices—is not only an alternative to coercing them; it is also an alternative to persuading them.

There are serious educational implications here as well. Once the incentives are no longer available, the desired behavior is likely to stop.
