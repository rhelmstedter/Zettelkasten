Assertion helpers are separate functions that deal with complicated assertion checks. Instead of using assert directly in a test, factor out the complicated assertion into a stand alone function, then call the function in the test. You can use `__tracebackhide__ = True` to ignore the assertion helper during traceback. An example from the book is below:

```python
from cards import Card
import pytest


def assert_identical(c1: Card, c2: Card):
    __tracebackhide__ = True
   assert c1 == c2
   if c1.id != c2.id:
       pytest.fail(f"id's don't match. {c1.id} != {c2.id}") 

def test_identical():
    c1 = Card("foo", id=123)  
    c2 = Card("foo", id=456)  
    assert_identical(c1, c2)
```

`assert_identical()` is the assertion helper, and `test_identical()` is the actual test. This would fail since the ids don't match.
