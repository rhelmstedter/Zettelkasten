A common pattern for structuring tests is Arrange–Act–Assert (aka, Given–When–Then). Arrangement is where you set up data or the environment and get ready for the action. This could be initializing an object or creating a mock. Action is the behavior we are attempting to test. Assert is checking whether the expected matches the result of the action.
