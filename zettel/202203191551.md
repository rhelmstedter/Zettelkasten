To get the count of values that meet some criteria, chain your criteria with `.sum()`. Harrison uses the city_mpg series as an example. For cars with mpg greater than 20:

```python
(city_mpg
.gt(20)
.sum()
)
```

To calculate the percentage of values that meet some criteria you can multiply 100 and take the mean. 

```python
(city_mpg
.gt(20)
.mul(100)
.mean()
)
```

This leverages the fact that python treats booleans as 1 and 0. Summing a series of boolean values results in *counting* the number of True values. And if you take average, the result is the fraction of values that are True.
