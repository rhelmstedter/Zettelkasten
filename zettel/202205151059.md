Raymond Hettinger just keeps the hits coming. He discusses how [dataclasses](202109302002.md) will generate boilerplate code for you.

When using dataclasses, the probability of students writing classes correctly increases, while their understanding of what is happening behind the scenes decreases. This implies that students are able to perform actions without understanding what they are doing. This can lead to sort of false positives. Teachers may implement methods that result in an increase of performance but students have not actually learned how to use a give concept outside of the narrow context provided by the teacher.
