Generators continue to confuse me. I recognize that generators are useful for saving memory. Instead of creating every element in a list all at once, it will `yield` items only when necessary.

Bite 146 threw me for a loop because it asked to use a generator to generate a rhombus. My gut instinct was to create the first half of the rows using a list, then use slicing to reverse and get the second half. This fails to use the generators as intended since I have to create the entire list and then `yield` the formatted string.

My _terrible_ solution:

```python
STAR = "*"
def gen_rhombus(width):
    top_half = [num for num in range(1, width + 2, 2)]
    rows = top_half + top_half[-2::-1]
    for row in rows:
        yield f"{row*STAR: ^{width}}"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(gen_rhombus(width=7))
```

:POC:
I went with the solution above because I thought of the `yield` statement similar to return. My misconception was that after yielding all items it would exit the function. Turns out, you can have multiple `yield` statements. The proposed solution from PyBites leverages this idea as shown below.


PyBites Proposed Solution:

```python
STAR = '*'


def _print_row(i, width):
    return f'{STAR*i: ^{width}}'


def gen_rhombus(width):
    # upper half
    for i in range(1, width+1, 2):
        yield _print_row(i, width)
    # lower half ('width-2' to not repeat middle row)
    for i in range(width-2, 0, -2):
        yield _print_row(i, width)
```
