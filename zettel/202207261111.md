Hermans identifies three types of confusion. A lack of knowledge indicates an insufficient supply of facts stored in long-term memory. A lack of information indicates there are multiple sources of data that must be complied together and stored in short-term memory. And a lack of processing power which indicates there is too much information to process within our with working memory ([The Mental Game of Python by Hettinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANN2Eu6ZnM&t=423s)). When trying to trace (mentally execute a program) complex program, you may find the need to write down various values and intermediate steps.
