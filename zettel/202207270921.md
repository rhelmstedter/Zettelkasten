There is a saying in the developer world along the lines of, "Code is written once, but read multiple times." It has never quite sat right with me. Especially when it is considering good practice to refactor your code, you have already written the code more than once. Hermans offers more satisfactory answers.

Developers spend almost [60% of their time trying to _understand_ code](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7997917), which involves reading, tracing, and making sense of code that is already written. In order to add features, debug, or understand a larger system, you must read code.
