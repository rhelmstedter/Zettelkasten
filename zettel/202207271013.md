Hermans claims that research shows that programmers read comments. High-level comments that describe behavior can assist programmers in mentally chunking portions of code. Whereas low-level comments can impede chunking. 

I do not remember the source, but read somewhere "comments should describe the why, not the what." I'm not sure Hermans would agree with that. As long as you are describing the what at an appropriate level that assists in understanding the bigger picture, it can still be helpful.
