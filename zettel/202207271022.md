>Beacons are parts of a program that help a programmer understand what the code does (p. 47).

There are simple and compound beacons. Simple beacons include meaningful variable names. Compound beacons form when simple beacons work together to provide insight into the code. A `for` can be a compound beacon because it consists of the variable and the iterable. Choosing good labels for for each simple beacon leads to a sum that is greater than its individual components.

E.g., when iterating of a list of colors in python I would do something like:

```python
for color in colors:
	# do something with each color
```

The choice of labels provides context for what the code is doing.
