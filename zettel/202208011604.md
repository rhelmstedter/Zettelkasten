Hermans offers several strategies to assist with transferring information from short-term memory to long-term memory (see: [Memory](202207271037.md)). When learning new syntax, use flashcards paired with retrieval practice. The act of recalling information—even if you do not remember entirely or correctly—strengthens LTM over time. For more complex ideas and concepts, use [elaboration](202012131810.md) to organize new information within your [schemata](202208011650.md). Recognizing relationships between ideas leads to better retention because when memories are connected, they become easier to find. As a result, active elaboration strengthens the network of memories and eases retrieval.
