Memories are stored in a network of relationships to other memories and facts. The way in which they are stored are called schemas, or schemata (Hermans, 2012). According to Boser (2017), the [Knowledge Effect](202208011658.md) plays a crucial role in learning because expertise requires fluency. With solid schemata in place, new knowledge has context in which it can seat.

It is important to note that memories can be altered to fit existing schemata as we store them.
