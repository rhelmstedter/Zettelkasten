Value is closely associated with motivation. In order to learn, the content must hold value for the learner. Simply telling the learner that information is important can backfire due to the perceived loss of autonomy. We are more likely to engage with and therefore learn a topic with which we have experience (see: [The Knowledge Effect](202208011658.md)). While not implying that all content must be 'real world', value is about finding meaning in what you are learning.
