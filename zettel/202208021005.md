Hermans shares Sweller's work on on the three types cognitive load: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Each of these loads are relative to the experience level of the programmer. I.e., the more experience surrounding the problem, the lower the cognitive load.

Intrinsic load deals with the complexity of the problem itself. Extraneous load deals with added distractions. E.g., perhaps the notation being used is complicated or novel. The problem itself has not gotten any harder, but it is more difficult for the programmer to understand. Extraneous load is often introduces incidentally, making a problem harder than it needs to be. Programmers should work to reduce cognitive load.
