Refactoring is the process of changing the internal structure of a program, without changing the output. The most common form of refactoring is abstracting behavior into a function or method.

Refactoring requires finding balance between maintainability and readability. Localized code that is easy to read may not be maintainable, and delocalized code that is easy to maintain can increase the [cognitive load](202208021005.md) on your [working memory](202207271037.md). 

Sometimes sacrificing maintainability (especially temporarily) by [inlining code](202208021039.md) can reduce the extraneous load of the problem.
