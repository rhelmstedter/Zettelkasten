Boser describes two types of motivation: situational and deep. Situational can be cosidered, at least partly, incidental. Perhaps a topic is mentioned off hand, or the learner encounters a topic multiple times without intentionally seeking it out. If the learners interest has been piqued enough, this can transition into an intrinsic deep motivation. The act of learner a given topic becomes its own reward.

TODO connect this explicitly with Pink's work.
