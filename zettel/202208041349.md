The ability to understand relationships between facts and identify patterns separates experts from novices. In other words, they are able to take advantage of [the Knowledge Effect](202208011658.md). Boser illustrates this through the example of expert chess players. They are able to recognize more positions. By recognizing positions (instead of memorizing each individual piece) they are able to problem solve with their short-term and working memory.

Richland argues that to build concepts, solve problems, to engage in any sort of critical thinking, learnings must explore patterns within an area of expertise. I.e., higher order thinking boils down to reasoning about relationships. Experts find a way to see through complexity and chaos in order to understand the essence of an idea. Experts seek causes, analogies, and compare and contrast.
