Learning can be optimized if one develops a sense of their own zone of proximal development. Moreover, learners need to be the producers of their learning and make sense of the learning own their own for the long-term retention.

Content must be broken down into small enough pieces piece that it can be held in short memory then [transferred to LTM](202208011604.md). This is what Hermans refers to as a lack of information (see: [Types of Confusion](202207261111.md)). Otherwise the short-term memory is overwhelmed. It's like trying to run too many programs at once. It overloads the RAM.
