The learner should actively engage in retrieval practice. Without rereading, or going and looking something of they should attempt to retrieve whatever information they have been trying to learn. They should ask themselves questions about what they are learning (see: [Elaboration](202012131810.md)). Another exercise is to write a three-sentence essay that summaries the concept. The act of retrieval practice can be used as a learning tool in and of itself because it strengthens the network of knowledge stored in long-term memory (see: [Transferring Information to LTM](202208011604.md)).
