It is good practice to be consistent. Examples that stick out to me are string methods in Python such as `.islower()` and `isupper()` are examples of flags that evaluate to booleans. After developing a fundamental understanding, the cognitive load is lowered and reading methods that start with `is` becomes a sign that it is a flag.
