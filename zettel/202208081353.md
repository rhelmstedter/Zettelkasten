Hermans offers 7 strategies to use as you are reading code:

+ Activating: Thinking of related things to activate prior knowledge
+ Monitoring: Keeping track of your understanding of a text
+ Determining Important: Deciding what parts of a text are most relevant
+ Inferring: Filling in facts that are not explicitly given the text
+ Visualizing: Drawing diagrams of the read text to deepen understanding
+ Questioning: Asking questions about the text at hand
+ Summarizing: Creating a short summary of a text

All of these strategies align with Boser's assessment in [Learn Better](202208011656.md).
