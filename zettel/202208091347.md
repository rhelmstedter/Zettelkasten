Modeling can shed insight on a problem. Hermans mixes how she uses model. On one hand, she refers to modeling as drawing out the architecture of code on a whiteboard with it is too large to hold in working memory. On the other had she offers modeling as an approach to problem solving. She refers to the two trains problem. One can model the distance the bird has traveled between the two trains which leads to a complex sum. Or one can model the time it takes for the two trains to meet. I am not sure those two uses of the word model are the same.

All models are not created equal.
