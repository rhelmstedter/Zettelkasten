Hermans' definition:: A mental model creates an abstraction in your working memory that you can use to reason about the problem at hand (p. 127).

Her example is thinking of a file system as a model for a hard drive. Files can be grouped together in folders (directories).

While useful, mental models can fall short. Programmers need to be comfortable updating their models as they gain new information. However, even when the programmer develops a better model, the old _wrong_ model doesn't just disappear. That is not how the network of knowledge stored in the brain works. Until the paths leading to the new model are better formed than the paths leading to the old it is common to revert to the old model under times of high-cognitive load.

Not all mental models are created equally. Johnson-Laird describe mental models as situated in working memory. Concrete models that contain sufficient details work better for reasoning about systems in a case by by case manner. Gentner and Stevens on the other hand argue that generic mental models are stored in long-term memory (LTM). Under this view, it would be better to build up a vocabulary of mental models that can be retrieved from LTM and applied as needed. LTM mental models include concepts like:

+ Data Structures
+ Design Patterns
+ Architectural Patterns
+ Diagrams
+ Modeling tools
