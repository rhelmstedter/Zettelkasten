[Mental Models](202208091355.md) can be used to reason about a program and [develop understanding of a program](202208081347.md). Mental models do not have to start out purely mental. Take advantage of whiteboards, paper, or digital tools to physically map things out if necessary. This will lower the initial cognitive load. Seek out analogies.

1. Create local Models
	
	+ Start small and perhaps learn on a visual aide such as creating a state table and dependency graph. Then use these small models to chunk information together and fit into into the overall model.

2. List all relevant objects in the codebase and the relationships between them.
3. Answer Questions about the system and use the answers to refine the model.

	+ What are the most important elements (classes, objects, pages) of the system? Are they present in the model?
     + What are the relationships between these important elements?
     + What are the main goals of the program?
     + How does the goal relate to the core elements and their relationships?
     + What is a typical use case? Is it covered in the model?
