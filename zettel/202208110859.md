Notional machines are the abstractions we use to reason about how a computer functions. Hermans claims this is distinct from a mental model. Notional machines contain the concept of "state". When comparing a variable to a box that "stores" information in it, we are using a notional machine. _Opening_ and _closing_ files on a computer are examples of notional machines since technically we mean that we are allowed to read text or not.

All of this matters to say, that when abstracting away details by using a notional machine, is it easy to abstract relative details. It is crucial to reexamine your notional machine to ensure it aligns with reality. 

One example that speaks to me, is the notional machine of a variable being a box that contains something vs a variable being a label that points to something stored in memory. The first NM is easier to understand, but falls short when you assign something twice.
