Chess is often touted as a candidate for positive transfer. I.e., learning chess will develop logic and reasoning skills and improve general intelligence and memory. Studies imply that this is not true. Expert chess players do not show increased short term memory, and chess skills don't seem to transfer to other logical games.


:?: So what the fuck? How do we teach logical thinking if it doesn't seem to transfer well?
