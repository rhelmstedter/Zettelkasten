Hermans presents a formal definition of _misconception_ which contains three elements. In order for a belief to be a misconception it must:

1. be faulty
2. be held consistently, across different situations
3. be held with confidence.

Misconceptions are fixed with [Conceptual Change](202208150937.md). Another strategy for dealing with misconceptions is to deliberately study common misconceptions in order to avoid them in your own code.
