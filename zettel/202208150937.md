Misconceptions are difficult to fix because they have rooted deeply into the schemata given the programmer a sense of confidence. Often is is not enough to point out the flaw in the logic; rather a new way of thinking about the topic needs to take root. This new schemata needs to be recalled more often than the original faulty (also see: [Mental Models](202208091355.md)). This idea is referred to as _conceptual change_. 

Conceptual change learning is more difficult than regular learning because in addition to the new learning, you must _unlearn_ the old—inaccurate—knowledge as well. The paths to the misconceptions are not destroyed immediately upon new learning and may be triggered especially when under high-cognitive load.
