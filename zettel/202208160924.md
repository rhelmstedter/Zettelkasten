Feitelson created a study where he had some subjects use the model shown below to construct names, and other subjects construct names on their own. The judges preferred the names that stemmed from the model.

Three-step naming model:

1. Decide what concepts should be embedded in the name.
2. Decide what word should represent each concept.
3. Decide on the structure of the name and the order of the chosen words.

These do not necessarily have to be done in order. But spending the time to think about all three facets can lead to better names and thereby better mental models for the program.
