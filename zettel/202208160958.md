Hermans describes two frameworks for antipatterns. Structural antipatterns, in which the code is correct but structured in a way that is not easy to process, and conceptual antipatterns in which the structure is easy to process, but contains confusing or misleading names.

Arnaoudova, a professor at Washington state, describes [linguistic antipatterns](202208161007.md) (a subset of conceptual antipatterns) as inconsistencies between the linguistic meaning of names and the roles they play within the codebase.
