Arnaoudova's six linguistic antipatterns

| Antipattern                | Description                                         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Over-achieving method      | Methods that do more than they say                  |
| Under-achieving method     | Methods that say more than they do                  |
| Hypocritical Method        | Methods that do the opposite of what they say       |
| Over-achieving Identifier  | name indicates an entity contains more than it does |
| Under-achieving Identifier | name indicates an entity contains less than it does |
| Hypocritical Identifier    | name indicates the opposite of what it does         |

I created the antipattern names to go along with the descriptions. Not sold on them yet.
