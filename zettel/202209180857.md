Extend mastery by synthesizing ideas. Create more complexity with what you already know by playing riffs on a common theme. Utilize the facts you know in different combinations to build a more nuanced understanding of existing knowledge and forge new connections. Write [Three-sentence Essays](202209180904.md), [Squeeze and Stretch](202209180922.md) ideas, think about how you would create a lesson to teach someone else an idea. 

As an analogy, think of a coder on their way to become a programmer. Their thinking begins to transcend fundamentals like syntax, and they see how those facts fit together (see: [Pattern Expertise](202208041349.md)).
