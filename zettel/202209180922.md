[Sawyer](http://keithsawyer.com/bio/), offers a stretch and squeeze approach. Stretching an idea into the abstract can reveal generlizations and potential solutions to problems. Squeezing an idea into the concrete can offer insight into the details of a problem. This can build a more nuanced understanding.

This is an example of being a skeptical learner and is hard to do. We gravitate towards the path of least resistance and being comfortable. Stretching and squeezing requires grappling with ambiguity and shifting thinking according to nuanced information. In short, [Learning is Emotional](202208041355.md).
