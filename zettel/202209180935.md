Teaching can be a great way to learn. Researchers call this the protege effect. Create a lesson on a given topic. Artivulate important details in your own words. Ask yourself what is the best way to explain this? How will my audience understand this notion? What is the most important take away? 

The [Metacognition](202208041344.md) required by these types of questions leads to a better understanding even if the learner never actually gives the lesson.

An example of this is David Ronnquist who would learn things by answering questions on Stack Overflow.
