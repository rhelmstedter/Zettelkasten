When solving problems information is rarely tidy and clean. It is messy, often solvers are provided with a surplus of unnecessary information, or a deficit of information requiring more research. A key problem solving strategy is to determine what are deep details of a problem and what are the shallow details of the problem.

Deep details are those that contain the essence of the problem. While shallow details maybe nothing more than distractions. Exposure to multiple problems with varied shallow features that retain the same deep features can strengthen the understanding of the topic at hand.
