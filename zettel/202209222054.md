ITM is an antipattern in Python where you initialize something outside a for loop and then modify it in a for loop. He offers the example of building a [Data Frame](202107021134.md) from data scraped from a website. The original code initializes an empty list and the iterates over some elements appending to the initialized list.

```python

# original
col = []
for t in tr_elements[0]:
    name = t.text_content()
    col.append((name, []))
    
# refactored
cols = [t.test_context(), []) for t in tr_elements]
```
