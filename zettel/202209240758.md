Constructing analogies forces the learner to compare and contrast. (Again the [The Knowledge Effect](202208011658.md) comes into play because you have more facts with which to compare you current topic.) Analogies can bridge the gap between existing knowledge and new knowledge. Analogies don't have to be perfect to hold power. Be the skeptical learner who [squeezes and stretch](202209180922.md) analogies trying to break them. This can lead to more nuanced understanding.
