Boser offers a four-step plan for problem solving.

1. Understand
2. Plan
3. Execute
4. Reflect

Work to understand the problem until you can develop a problem statement of 1-2 sentences as if you were explaining it to a child. This forces you to identify essence of the problem and ensure you have a deep, nuanced understanding. Then create a plan of attack. Pull from your existing knowledge and experience and apply methods that have worked in the past. Execute the plan without too much deviation. This is important because even if the plan and execution fails, that gives you new information. Changing course on a whim, convolutes the process making it more difficult during the reflection period. Independent of the success or failure of the plan and execution, reflect on the process. What new things have you learned? Does this impact your understanding of the problem?

Throughout this entire process, ask yourself questions along the way:

+ Is there enough evidence?
+ Is there a counter argument?
+ Where is my logic weak?
+ What are my assumptions?
+ What are my biases?
