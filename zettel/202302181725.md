You squat between your legs, not on top of them.

Learn the squat stance: jump three times and let you feet fall naturally.

Bend down and push your right knee out with your right elbow. Push your left knee out with your left elbow. Sit up and you have squatted. It is often easier to do this with a load to counter balance, enter the goblet squat.
