The five constants that govern the art of war:
+ Moral Law
+ Heaven
+ Earth
+ Commander
+ Method and Discipline

The moral law is that which causes the people to be in accordance with their leader. Individuals act without concern for any danger or consequences to themselves.

Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons, the atmosphere, and the momentum.

Earth consists of the physical landscape of the conflict. Distances to be covered and secured.

Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, and strictness.

Method and Discipline describes the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank, logistical operations, and control of the military expenditure and how resources, time, and energy are spent. How well does everyone do their job?
