The seven searching questions forecast victory or defeat. They seek to identify the relationship between the two sides and [The Five Constants](202303041348.md).

1. Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the moral law?
2. Which of two generals has most ability?
3. With whom lie the advantages derived from heaven and earth?
4. On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
5. Which army is stronger?
6. On which side are officers and men most highly trained?
7. In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?

Modern interpretation of the seven searching questions:

1. Which side do the masses follow?
2. Who has the strongest leader?
3. How do both external and physical factors impede and fortify each side?
4. Which side is the most consistent internal? On which side do more people do their job?
5. Which side has the strongest will?
6. Which side is able to remain cool under pressure?
7. Which side is the most consistent with reward and punishment?

:?: How does this work with guerilla warfare? What if there is no clear leader for the other side?
